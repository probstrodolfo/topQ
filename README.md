Little Python script to pull, in descending order, reads based on Q-scores from fastq file.

Make sure to check information below!


. Change n=reads as you please

. You need to have Anaconda or Miniconda installed to use Bio

. For current version, you need to replace input fastq every time you run program (I am still working on parallelizing, but issue with unique empty quality scores for different MSAs impedes that for now).
